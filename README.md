# /wcg/'s next-gen pastebins

Comics we know of, all of which are named Kaito Shuno: [main.md](main.md)\
I don't care about the story as long as she draws porn: [smut.md](smut.md)

Those lists used to be hosted on [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/), then [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr/).

## How to contribute

### If you can't use Git

You can get access to an **online editor** by asking in the thread to be added as a collaborator to this repository or as a member to the organization that owns it. A GitHub organization is a group of GitHub accounts and our organization is called [Webcomics General](https://github.com/webcomics-general).

You will need to let us know your **GitHub username** to be invited, so we recommend **using an account that does not expose your actual identity**.

Note that you will have to provide GitHub an email address in order to open an account with them. Check in your GitHub settings that GitHub keeps your email address **private**. You may also have to configure a [two-factor authentication method](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication), I'm not sure.

### If you know your way around Git

Please fork this repository and open a pull request with your changes. Alternatively, ask in the thread for write access to the repository or membership in the organization, and you will be able to push to this repository directly.

Beware not to expose your actual identity in your commits (`user.name`, `user.email`).

### In any case

The pastebins are written in Markdown (`.md` extension). It's easy:

* [Cheat sheet](https://commonmark.org/help/) and [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
* Hyperlinks: `[link text](https://...)`.
* Line break in paragraph: add `\` at the end of the line.
