## SUGGESTED CATALOG FILTERS
##
## This file contains patterns for filtering out most of the trash that makes up
## the /lgbt/ board. As a result of the filtering, the board's catalog becomes
## easier to navigate, as many of the threads are hidden. A pattern is also
## suggested to highlight our /wcg/ thread, so that it is even easier to locate
## in the filtered catalog.
##
## Click "Filters" in the board's catalog to specify your choice of patterns.
## For every pattern:
##
## * Select "Hide" if you want matching threads to be omitted from the catalog.
## * Select "Top" if you want matching threads to be listed first in the
##   catalog.
## * Select a color if you want matching threads to be highlighted by a colored
##   border in the catalog.
##
## Patterns apply to all boards unless you specify a space-separated list of
## boards where they apply.
##
## Click "?" for more help.
##
## COOKIES
##
## The filters you specify are saved in a cookie when you click "Save". If you
## clear your cookies, your filters will go. Browsers normally make it possible
## to exclude certain cookies from being deleted.
##
## In Firefox, for instance, adding an "Allow" cookie exception for
## "https://4chan.org" excludes 4chan cookies from being deleted when Firefox is
## closed, if that option is selected.
##
## PATTERNS AND MATCHING
##
## Patterns enclosed in forward slashes are apparently JavaScript regular
## expressions, see:
##
## https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions
## https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Cheatsheet
##
## Default regexp matching is case-sensitive. Append "i" for a case-insensitive
## search: /regexp/i.
##
## Patterns not enclosed in forward slashes appear to be simpler glob patterns
## which are matched case-insensitively, although only *, not ? nor [], is
## recognized as a metacharacter.
##
## The match appears to be looked for in the whole "Subject: OP comment" text
## under every image in the catalog, or in only one of "Subject" and "OP
## comment" if the other is empty. The image filename is also looked in!

# Put the following pattern first in the list of filters in order to filter our
# thread IN (i.e. select "Top" and/or a color, not "Hide"). Explicitly filtering
# our thread in prevents it from being accidentaly filtered OUT as a false
# positive of any of the later filters.

# Protect other threads you're interested in from accidental filtering, for
# instance:
gaygen|bigen|ftmg

# Filter out the words "trans", "transgender", "transgirl" (with or without
# intermediate space), "transwoman/women" (same), "transition", "transmax" and
# their derivatives such as "transgirls" and "transitioning" while not matching
# other words that start with "trans" such as "translation", "transportation",
# "transistor" etc. Since I'm even less interested reading about trannies on
# other boards, it's a universal filter (i.e. it applies to all boards).
/\b(T|t)rans\b/
/\b(T|t)rans(gender| ?girls?| ?wom[ae]n|ition.*|max.*)\b/

# The previous two filters also filter out FtM threads that mention "trans",
# "transgender" or "transition". If you want to preserve those, replace the
# previous two filters with the following one. Alternatively, protect the FtM
# threads you're interested in, such as /ftmg/, by filtering them IN beforehand
# (see above).
/\b(T|t)rans( ?girls?| ?wom[ae]n|max.*)\b/

# Filter out "troon", "tranny" and derivatives such as "trooning out", "tranner"
# and "trannies". Obviously universal. Also, "tttt", but not universal.
troon*|trann*
tttt

# Self-explanatory. As a bonus it filters out "oh no, X-sissies, what will we
# do?".
agp*|hsts*|blanchard*|hrt|ffs|mtf*|*siss*|egg|terf*

# Also self-explanatory. I could fit this into one big filter, but I prefer
# dividing them up into manageable chunks if I want to add something without the
# risk of making other filters not work.
*brain*|repress*|pass*|repper*|chase*|repg*
voice train*

# Filter out any word that contains "hon" unless followed by "est", so "hon",
# "shoulderhons", "honfidence", but not "honestly".
/\b.*hon(?!est).*\b/i

# Again, self-explanatory. Maybe remove inject* to keep FtM threads.
*estro*|progest*|hormon*|inject*
dysphor*

# Filters out all known to me combinations of "be a woman".
/(be|been|become|is) a[ \w]+(woman|girl)/i

# Prunes out AMAB/AFAB talk and various capitalisations of it.
/\ba[mfg]ab\b/i

# All babble about Xmodders out.
/\b(boy|man|girl)mod/i

# For that one obese spammer.
"kino pairing"

# Fetishists begone (universal).
diaper

# Universal filter that prunes out threads that begin with a quote (>), leaving
# intact those that begin with a quote link (>>). There are no good 4chan
# threads that begin with a quote, it's either shitposting, trolling, bait,
# astroturfing, raiding or all of the above.
/^&gt;(?!&gt;)/

# Another universal filter: those two words, in any order, so will match all the
# "virgin X vs chad Y" shitposts.
virgin chad

# Clears out the catalogue of all Xpillers and femboy (cryptotranny) shit. As a
# bonus it gets rid of annoying tomboyhets in /a/djacent boards.
*mboy*|*pill*

# Also for the easily trollable boards like /tg/ it's prudent to include this
# filter that blocks lazy baitposts which end in question marks. If it's a
# question followed by something else, it has a chance of not being retarded, so
# the filter leaves it.
